Machine Learning algorithms using python programming language for beginner to advance level.
# Introduction
Machine learning (ML) has become an integral part of modern technology, driving innovations in various fields such as healthcare, finance, and transportation. 
Understanding the different types of machine learning algorithms is crucial for selecting the appropriate model for a given problem.
This Repo delves into the primary categories of machine learning algorithms, providing examples and use cases for each for diffrent domains with code.

1. Supervised Learning Algorithms
Supervised learning algorithms are used when the output (target) variable is known and the model is trained on labeled data.
The goal is to learn a mapping from input variables to the output variable.

2. Unsupervised Learning Algorithms
Unsupervised learning algorithms are used when the output variable is unknown, and the goal is to find patterns or structure in the data.

3. Reinforcement Learning Algorithms
Reinforcement learning algorithms learn by interacting with an environment, making decisions, and receiving feedback through rewards or penalties.

4. Semi-Supervised Learning Algorithms
Semi-supervised learning algorithms use a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data to improve learning accuracy.

This repo will provide the insights of all the Learning algorithms with examples.
